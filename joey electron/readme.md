# Joey Electronstension  
This chrome extension replaces the words you see on webpages with specifc memes. This will not tamper with HTML tag properties such as the destination of links and it should work on all HTML text so if you can highlight the text it should convert if it is a trigger for a meme.  
# Installation: easy method (.crx)  
1. download the most recent chrome extension file (joey electron #.###.crx)  
(in chrome) type chrome://extensions in the top bar. hit enter.  
3. If the download is still at the bottom of your chrome window drag and drop it into the extensions page. If it's not at the bottom of the screen, go to where you downloaded it in your file library and drag and drop it into the extensions page.  
4. If you see something about extensions harming your computer, make sure you are in chrome and the top bar says chrome://extensions and you're on the extensions pageand try again. When you are about do drop it it should say move, not copy.  
5. You should see something saying add extension or cancel. Once you add it, you're done. buena thuerte
# Installation: other method (.zip)  
1. download and extract the ZIP folder for the most recent version of the extension. If you can't extract ZIP folders download each file individually and put them in a folder named joey electron or something that you'll remember to be the extension (the folder name doesn't matter).  
2. (in chrome) type chrome://extensions in the top bar. hit enter.  
3. click the checkbox to enable developer mode  
4. click load unpacked extension. Find the folder that you extracted to. don't use the zip folder. Select that folder.
5. make sure the extension is enabled by clicking the checkbox to the right. I also recommend enableing it in incognito mode (deadass)
