A 3D random walk starts at the origin and at every step,
it chooses either up, down, left, right, forward, or
backward randomly and takes a step in that direction.
I drew the path of the walk and made older parts more
transparent. I also made 10 walkers each with different
colors. When a walker reaches the boundary, it is sent 
backto the origin, given a new color, and its history is
wiped. I added automatic rotation to the 3D camera, but
you can pan and zoom with your mouse.
